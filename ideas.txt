- Add a way for the user to pass a version of python in the cli args, to test with vermin. Right now defaults to 3.8.

- Add a way for the user to optionally test that the entire vermin output message matches some string.

- Add a way for the user to specify any files that should be empty (e.g., __init__ file). By default,
  just test that __init__ files (and only them) are empty, like you do now.
    - If the files are in a folder, have the user be able to specify this somehow, without using
      os-specific path notation in the .lintception file.

- Add a way for the user to exclude a certain file from being tested by vulture. E.g., run lintception
  on the python stockfish project, stuff in `models.py` is unused but that's fine.

- Test flake8 with flags github actions use?

- For the `my_linter.py` script, consider adding a way to only count a function call if it's non-recursive.
    - E.g., could track the lines of all the functions in the project, and then if the latest function
      a call is after is the same function as the one being called, it's likely recursive (or a global call).

# Test that there are no function definitions with the same name as commonly used (esp builtin)
  function names. E.g., sum, count (from itertools), all, any, etc.
